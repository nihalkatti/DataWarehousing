# DataWarehousing


Introduction :
In this project, we apply the Data Warehouse architectures we learnt and build a Data Warehouse on AWS cloud. We build an ETL pipeline to extract and transform data stored in json format in s3 buckets and move the data to Warehouse hosted on Amazon Redshift.


Project Overview
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
